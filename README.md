## Project Details:
Ever since I received my Frame1 controller at the beginning of April, I tried to find an input viewer for the device and couldn't find one. So, I decided to make one for personal use in a couple days. Once it was seemingly operating correctly, I decided to try to spruce it up, make it more useable for other people and release it publicly.
