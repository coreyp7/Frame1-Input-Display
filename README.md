# Frame1 Controller Input Display
![](https://i.imgur.com/OmME40D.png)

*NOTE: This input display is not an official release from the Frame1 team, this is simply something I made for my personal use.*

## Resources Utilized:

### This input viewer utilizes a [Python binding of Windows joystick API](https://github.com/Rabbid76/python_windows_joystickapi) published by [Rabbid76](https://github.com/Rabbid76). This was an incredibly important component of this project, and all respective credit goes to Rabbid76.

GUI created with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

[Frame1](https://frame1.gg/) Controller created by **Stephen "Greg Turbo" Kasmir**.

## Project Details:
Ever since I received my Frame1 controller(solid product so far) at the beginning of April, I tried to find an input viewer for the device and couldn't find one. So, I decided to make one for personal use in a couple days. Once it was seemingly operating correctly, I decided to try to spruce it up, make it *slightly* more useable for other people and release it publicly in case anyone was also looking for something to use. 

So be warned that this hasn't been thoroughly tested or anything, and has some small problems *(although they don't ruin the application for my use)*.

Some example screenshots with some different color presets.
