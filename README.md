# Frame1 Controller Input Display
Utilizing a [Python binding of Windows joystick API](https://github.com/Rabbid76/python_windows_joystickapi) published by [Rabbid76](https://github.com/Rabbid76). Without this resource, this project would've proved to be very different than it is, and much more difficult. 

This readme will be completed when appropriate. Since this is still in development, I'm leaving as is.
